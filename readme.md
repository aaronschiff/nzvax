Vaccination doses administered and HSU population are aggregated for all combinations of ethnicities, three age groups, and DHB area. People of "unknown" or "various" ethnicity are excluded. People in the "unknown / overseas" DHB area are also excluded. 

People who are fully vaccinated (two doses) are also included in the chart of first doses, i.e. the first doses chart shows people who have received one or more doses, not the people who have received only one dose.
